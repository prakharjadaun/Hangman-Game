# **Hangman Game**

I have implemented hangman game with C++. It is a digital version of the classic word-guessing game. In this game, players must guess the hidden word by guessing individual letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman diagram is drawn, and if the player is unable to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn, they lose the game. The project hangman game allows players to play this game on their computer.

The game features a user-friendly interface that allows players to easily enter their guesses and track their progress. The project hangman game is a fun and engaging way to practice vocabulary and spelling, and can be enjoyed by players of all ages. It is a simple but addictive game that provides hours of entertainment and challenge. 

I hope you find this interesting!
