# **Hangman Game**

I have implemented the popular game 'Hangman' with C++. If you don't know the game of hangman, don't worry. It is basically a word guessing game and you get a certain amount of choices to guess the word and if you fail to do so, then you loses the game. 

When you compile this project, firstly it greets you with the rules of the game and then asks you to enter the name of yours. Then a random word is generated by the program and you are asked to do guess it. Whenever you guesses a correct letter, that letter is been filled in the blank spaces. And whenever you guess wrong letter, hangman keeps on completing. 

I hope you find this interesting!
